Custom-EV3-My-Block-Icons
=========================
To install our custom icons use the "Download ZIP" button on the GITHub Project Page get a .zip file of the icons.  Then unzip it and copy the contents of the images folder to your \LEGO MINDSTORMS Edu EV3\Resources\MyBlocks\images directory (or equivalent).  The Wiki page documents how to make your own icons.  Please fork our project and add to our collections of Icons.
